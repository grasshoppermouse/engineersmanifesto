America has the knowledge, technology, and resources to address the unfolding crises that our country faces -- unchecked and unsustainable patterns of growth, extreme wealth concentration, and the overarching threat of climate change. These specters need not drive our society to disintegration. And yet we, as a nation, have been unable to step up to these challenges - not due to a lack of technical ability, but because the dysfunction in our society and government has already reached the point that most of us cannot even recognize the imminent danger posed by the threats in our midst, and the accelerating disunity in America has made us incapable of springing into action to face those threats. And make no mistake - these looming threats *will* result in an ecological cataclysm if we do not radically change the way we are structured and how we operate.

This manifesto, written by a systems engineer with over twenty-five years of experience, aims to contribute to the public dialogue an understanding of how the tools of systems engineering can be applied to fix our broken civil and societal systems so that we can begin the necessary, radical, and rapid response to climate change. There is a tendency, when thinking through the current state of national and world affairs and projecting today's problems and crises into the future, to despair. This manifesto is intended to counter that despair with a structured approach, demonstrating that, using only the tools we already have at hand, we can still establish a well-functioning and sustainable society.
